## **Python’s Core Data Structures — Choose the Right Tool**

*“DSA is easy… when you know where your data lives.”*

---

## 🟡 **Why Learn Data Structures First?**

Most people fail at DSA not because they can’t write code — but because they’re using the wrong structure.  
Today, I’m diving into **9 core Python data structures** that you **must** know to write clean, efficient solutions.

---

### 🔹 **1\. List — Python’s Built-in Dynamic Array**

**What it is**:  
An ordered collection that can grow/shrink, supports indexing, slicing, iteration.

**When to use**:

* When you need to store ordered items
    
* When index-based access is required
    
* Great for implementing stacks/queues manually
    

```python
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
fruits.append('mango')
print(fruits[1])  # Output: banana
print(fruits)     # Output: ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry', 'mango']
```

---

### 🔹 **2\. Tuple — Immutable List**

**What it is**:  
A fixed-size, ordered collection — can’t be modified after creation.

**When to use**:

* When you want to protect the data from being changed
    
* Useful for coordinates, return values, or as dictionary keys
    

```python
point = (10, 20)
print(point[0])  # Output: 10
# point[0] = 30 ❌ Error: Tuples are immutable
```

---

### 🔹 **3\. Set — Unordered Unique Collection**

**What it is**:  
Stores **only unique items** and allows **fast membership tests**.

**When to use**:

* When you need to **eliminate duplicates**
    
* When you need **fast lookup** (`O(1)` on average)
    
* For intersection, union, difference operations
    

```python
nums = {1, 2, 3, 3, 2}
nums.add(4)
print(nums)       # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4}
print(2 in nums)  # Output: True
```

---

### 🔹 **4\. Dict — Key-Value Store (Hash Table)**

**What it is**:  
A mapping between unique keys and values.

**When to use**:

* When you want to **store relationships** (like name ➝ age)
    
* When you need **fast lookups by key**
    
* When building **frequency maps**, caches, graphs
    

```python
student = {"name": "Goutham", "age": 24}
student["grade"] = "A"
print(student["name"])  # Output: Goutham
print(student)          # Output: {'name': 'Goutham', 'age': 24, 'grade': 'A'}
```

---

### 🔹 **5\. Stack — Last In First Out (LIFO)**

**What it is**:  
A structure where the last element added is the first one removed.

**When to use**:

* Backtracking problems
    
* Undo functionality
    
* Balanced parentheses, DFS, reversing operations
    

```python
stack = []
stack.append(1)
stack.append(2)
stack.pop()        # Output: 2
print(stack)       # Output: [1]
```

---

### 🔹 **6\. Queue — First In First Out (FIFO)**

**What it is**:  
A structure where the first item added is the first removed.

**When to use**:

* Task scheduling
    
* BFS traversal in trees/graphs
    
* Producer-consumer problems
    

```python
from collections import deque

queue = deque()
queue.append(1)
queue.append(2)
queue.popleft()     # Output: 1
print(queue)        # Output: deque([2])
```

---

### 🔹 **7\. Heap — Priority Queue (Min-Heap)**

**What it is**:  
A binary heap where the smallest element is always on top.

**When to use**:

* When you need **top K smallest/largest**
    
* For **scheduling**, **Dijkstra’s shortest path**, **median in stream**
    

```python
import heapq

nums = [5, 1, 3]
heapq.heapify(nums)
heapq.heappush(nums, 2)
print(heapq.heappop(nums))  # Output: 1
print(nums)                 # Output: [2, 5, 3]
```

---

### 🔹 **8\. DefaultDict — Auto-Creates Default Values**

**What it is**:  
A dictionary that doesn’t crash when accessing non-existent keys.

**When to use**:

* For counting frequencies
    
* Grouping elements (like anagrams)
    
* Avoiding `KeyError` in nested logic
    

```python
from collections import defaultdict

freq = defaultdict(int)
freq['a'] += 1
print(freq['a'])  # Output: 1
print(freq['b'])  # Output: 0
```

---

### 🔹 **9\. Counter — Frequency Counter in One Line**

**What it is**:  
A subclass of `dict` for counting hashable objects.

**When to use**:

* Counting elements (like characters, words)
    
* When you want to avoid writing manual counting logic
    

```python
from collections import Counter

arr = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3]
count = Counter(arr)
print(count)     # Output: Counter({3: 3, 2: 2, 1: 1})
print(count[2])  # Output: 2
```

---

## ✅ **Day 4 Takeaways:**

* **Lists** = go-to for ordered data
    
* **Dicts** = best for fast key-value lookups
    
* **Sets** = uniqueness + fast membership
    
* **Stacks & Queues** = control order of processing
    
* **Heaps** = when priority matters
    
* **Counter & DefaultDict** = frequency problems = solved  
    Now you know *not just what they are*, but *when to use each one.*
