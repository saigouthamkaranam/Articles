**SDE in 12 Weeks: An Introduction to Web Development and My Learning Journey**

Welcome to my 12 Weeks of Software Development Engineer (SDE) series! Over the next three months, Iâ€™ll be immersing myself in the world of software development, with a focus on web development, following a well-structured roadmap. My goal? To see just how much I can learn and achieve in 12 weeks.

To kick things off, Iâ€™ll be starting with the fundamentals of web development. This includes:

* **Understanding the Internet:** A high-level overview of how the internet works.
    
* **Web Development Languages:** Exploring the different programming languages essential for web development.
    
* **Programming Basics:** Defining what programming is and how itâ€™s used.
    
* **Role of a Software Engineer:** Gaining insight into what software engineers do in their day-to-day roles.
    
* **Front-End vs. Back-End vs. Full-Stack:** Understanding the distinctions between front-end, back-end, and full-stack development.
    

Throughout this series, Iâ€™ll document my progress, share insights, and reflect on the challenges and successes I encounter. Learning is a collaborative effort, so I encourage you to join me, ask questions, and share your experiences. Together, we can make this journey not just educational, but also a rewarding community experience.

I will be using [Codeacedamy](https://www.codecademy.com/journeys/full-stack-engineer/paths/fscj-22-web-development-foundations/tracks/fscj-22-welcome-to-the-full-stack-engineer-path/modules/fscj-22-introduction-overview-of-web-development/informationals/fscp-22-introduction-overview-of-web-development) platform to learn and practice.

Stay tuned for weekly updates and letâ€™s see how much we can grow as developers in just 12 weeks!
