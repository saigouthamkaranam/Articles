## This time, it’s **one roadmap, one grind, no excuses.**

For the next **8 weeks**, I’m going all-in on mastering **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)**.

I’m not a DSA guru. I’ll make mistakes. I’ll struggle.  
But I’ll show up **every single day**.  
If you’re someone who wants to grind alongside — **welcome aboard**.  
No competition. No flexing. Just learning in public and getting 1% better.

Since we need an organized approach i am going to use this following roadmap  
[https://roadmap.sh/datastructures-and-algorithms](https://roadmap.sh/datastructures-and-algorithms)

*“I’m not perfect. I’m just willing to grind till I get it right.”* 💻🔥

```python
print("see you in the next post!")
