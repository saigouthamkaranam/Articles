## Topics for Week 1:

* The importance of having a good code!
    
* What is the BigO notation?
    
* What are the various rules of BigO notation?
    
* How do we calculate this BigO notation?
    
* What is time and space complexity?
    

For this series, I will be using Python as my programming language. But, this series is language-agnostic, which means you can still pretty much understand everything without the knowledge of any programming language.

```python
print("see you in the next post!")
```
