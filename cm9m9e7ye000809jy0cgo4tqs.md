Welcome back to Week 1 of my **12 Weeks SDE Journey**! This week was all about setting the stage. I explored the very basics of how the internet functions and how websites are created, focusing on 5 key topics. Here’s what I learned — explained with real-world examples and beginner-friendly breakdowns!

## 🌐 1. How the Internet Works – *The Digital Postal System*

Imagine you're sending a letter to a friend:

* You write it, put it in an envelope, write the address, and drop it in a mailbox.
    
* The post office routes it to your friend’s house.
    
* Your friend receives the letter and reads it.
    

Now, think of your **web browser** as the sender. When you type [`www.google.com`](http://www.google.com):

* Your request is the letter.
    
* The **DNS** (Domain Name System) is like the post office directory — it translates “[google.com](http://google.com)” into an IP address.
    
* The **Internet** carries that request as data packets.
    
* Google’s **server** receives it and sends back a response (the webpage).
    

**🧠 Key Concepts:**

* **Client**: Your browser
    
* **Server**: Where the website lives
    
* **HTTP/HTTPS**: Rules for sending and receiving
    
* **IP Address**: The internet's version of a home address

## 💻 2. Web Development Languages – *Building a House*

Imagine you’re constructing a house:

* **HTML** is the **structure** – the walls and layout.
    
* **CSS** is the **interior design** – the paint, fonts, and styling.
    
* **JavaScript** is the **electricity and plumbing** – the things that make it *do* stuff.
    

🧪 Example:

```html
<button onclick="alert('Hello!')">Click Me!</button>
```

* HTML creates the button.
    
* JavaScript adds interaction when it’s clicked.
    

## 🧠 3. Programming Basics – *Teaching a Robot*

Programming is like giving super-specific instructions to a robot.

For example, to get a robot to:

* Pick up a glass
    
* Pour water
    
* Stop when it’s full
    

You’d have to write every step in a language it understands.

**🧩 What is Common in every programming language:**

* **Variables**: Store data
    
* **Functions**: Reusable blocks of logic
    
* **Conditionals**: Making decisions (`if`/`else`)
    
* **Loops**: Repeating actions
    

🧪 Example in JavaScript:

```plaintext
=> in JavaScript

let name = "Learner";
if (name === "Learner") {
  console.log("Welcome back, Learner!");
}

=> In Python
name = "Learner"
if name == "Learner":
 print("Welcome back," + name + "!")
```

The above example prints **Welcome back , Learner!**

It is just the language (Syntax) that we use is different, the concepts are the same.  
\- Variable here is name is used to store the value called string (dataType).  
\- By using if Condition we are saying the system / Console that if the person name is Learner, then only Print **Welcome back , Learner!**

## 👨‍💻 4. Role of a Software Engineer – *More Than Just Coding*

When i was a kid, I used to think engineers just wrote code, but there’s so much more to it:

* **Understanding problems**
    
* **Designing efficient systems**
    
* **Collaborating with designers, testers, and managers**
    
* **Writing clean, maintainable code**
    
* **Continuous learning**
    

They’re part-architect, part-strategist, and full-time problem solvers.

## 🍽 5. Front-End vs. Back-End vs. Full-Stack – *The Restaurant Analogy*

Think of a website like a restaurant:

* **Front-End Developer** = Waiter + Menu Designer (the visuals, layout, buttons)
    
* **Back-End Developer** = Chef + Kitchen Staff (the logic, database, server)
    
* **Full-Stack Developer** = Does it all
    

**🔧 Technologies:**

* Front-End: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, etc
    
* Back-End: Node.js, Python, Java, MongoDB, SQL
    
* Full-Stack: Both ends combined

That is all for today, In the next post lets know about some popular programming languages, its advantages and what is the best programming language for web development and what i will be using in this series.
